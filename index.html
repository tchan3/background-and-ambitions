		I am looking to design my own website to showcase my own design work. This could potentially serve as an online portfolio for potential employers to look at. <br><br>I hope that this website will also serve as a platform to display other projects of mine, including photography. My goal is to create and design a simple web page with a clear structure in order to communicate with the viewer as easily as possible.</br>
